This was a very badly done service for turning a Trello list into a helpdesk UI.

Surprisingly, it had more paying users than [[246c2737]], which I was working on simultaneously and dedicating much more time to it.

The Neo4j database I used for this was a very poor choice, it was probably the cause of all the bugs.
