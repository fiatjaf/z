# Using Spacechains and Fedimint to solve scaling

What if instead of trying to create complicated "layer 2" setups involving noveau cryptographic techniques we just did the following:

- we take that Fedimint source code and remove the "mint" stuff, and just use their federation stuff secure coins with multisig;
- then we make a spacechain;
- and we make the federations issue multisig-btc tokens on it;
- and then we put some uniswap-like thing in there to allow these tokens to be exchanged freely.
