# jekmentions

This was a service that took [webmentions][webmentions], an "indiewebcamp" thing and turned them into notes on a special directory of a GitHub repo so they would be turned into rendered comments on a GitHub website rendered by the default Jekyll generator.

I ran a server for some time and there were some 2 or 3 people using it besides me.
