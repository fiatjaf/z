# Temperos

"Templates as a service", or "temperaas", changed to "temperos" later because it was a nice pun in Portuguese.

The ideas was that it would take an URL with any file and some querystring parameters, then replace `{{paramName}}` with the parameters from the querystring and serve it, all stateless.

Created to make it easy for people to embed scripts on [[246c2737]] (but of course it was too hard for most people).
