# idea: Patreon, but simple, and without subscription

Basically instead of a subscription and becoming member of something, you just get a forum for your inner circle and people get lnurl-pay codes they can use to donate. Some amount of donations is required to remain in the group (like x per month), but if you donate more than that on the beginning you can stay until your credits expire.

Every time someone donates a notice is posted in the group page.

Perhaps that could be an [@lntxbot](t.me/lntxbot) feature.
