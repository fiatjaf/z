# my personal approach on using `let`, `const` and `var` in javascript

Since these names can be used interchangeably almost everywhere and there are a lot of people asking and searching on the internet on how to use them (myself included until some weeks ago), I developed a personal approach that uses the declarations mostly as readability and code-sense sugar, for helping my mind, instead of expecting them to add physical value to the programs.

`let` is only for short-lived variables, defined at a single line and not changed after. Generally those variables which are there only to decrease the amount of typing. For example:

    for (let key in something) {
      /* we could use `something[key]` for this entire block,
         but it would be too much letters and not good for the
         fingers or the eyes, so we use a radically temporary variable
      */
      let value = something[key]
      ...
    }


`const` for all _names_ known to be constant across the entire module. Not including locally constant values. The `value` in the example above, for example, is constant in its scope and could be declared with `const`, but since there are many iterations and for each one there's a value with same **name**, "value", that could trick the reader into thinking `value` is always the same. Modules and functions are the best example of `const` variables:

    const PouchDB = require('pouchdb')
    const instantiateDB = function () {}
    const codes = {
      23: 'atc',
      43: 'qwx',
      77: 'oxi'
    }

`var` for everything that may or not be variable. Names that may confuse people reading the code, even if they are constant locally, and are not suitable for `let` (i.e., they are not completed in a simple direct declaration) apply for being declared with `var`. For example:

    var output = '\n'
    lines.forEach(line => {
      output += '  '
      output += line.trim()
      output += '\n'
    })
    output += '\n---'

    for (let parent in parents) {
      var definitions = {}
      definitions.name = getName(parent)
      definitions.config = {}
      definitions.parent = parent
    }
