# jiq

When someone created [`jiq`](https://github.com/simeji/jid) claiming it had "jq queries" I went to inspect and realized it didn't, it just had a poor simple JSON query language that implemented 1% of all [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) features, so I forked it and plugged `jq` directly into it, and renamed to `jiq`.

After some comments on issues in the original repository from people complaining about lack of `jq` compatibility it got a ton of unexpected users, was even packaged to ArchLinux.
