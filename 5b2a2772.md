# idea: An open log-based HTTP database for any use case

A single, read/write open database for everything in the world.

* A hosted database that accepts anything you put on it and stores it in order.
* Anyone can update it by adding new stuff.
* To make sense of the data you can read only the records that interest you, in order, and reconstruct a local state.
* Each updater pays a fee (anonymously, in satoshis) to store their piece of data.
* It's a single store for everything in the world.

### Cost and price estimates

Prices for guaranteed storage for 3 years:
20 satoshis = 1KB
20 000 000 = 1GB

https://www.elephantsql.com/ charges $10/mo for 1GB of data,
                                     3 600 000 satoshis for 3 years

If 3 years is not enough, people can move their stuff to elsewhere when it's time, or pay to keep specific log entries for more time.

### Other considerations

* People provide a unique id when adding a log so entries can be prefix-matched by it, like `myapp.something.random`
* When fetching, instead of just fetching raw data, add (paid?) option to fetch and apply a `jq` map-reduce transformation to the matched entries
