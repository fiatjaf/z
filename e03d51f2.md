# Sparko

This started as a reimplementation of the [Spark Wallet](https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet) server (which also included the client app, copied directly) because NodeJS isn't a proper way to distribute software to end users and it was also a pain for me to install. I could do a program that ran as a single binary.

Then when [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/) released their plugin infrastructe I made this a plugin.

And then introduced fine-grained method authorization for multiple keys, and full-blown [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)-based subscriptions for plugin events.

It is a now a single wrapper that can be used to develop apps that talk to a Lightning layer very easily, as well as a simple wallet.

It is integrated into [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/), [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) and <https://tip.bigsun.xyz/>.
