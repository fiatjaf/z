# rosetta.alhur.es

A service that grabs code samples from two chosen languages on [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) and displays them side-by-side.

The code-fetching is done in real time and snippet-by-snippet (there is also a prefetch of which snippets are available in each language, so we only compare apples to apples).

This was my first Golang web application if I remember correctly.
