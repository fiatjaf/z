# @lntxbot

A Telegram bot I made just because I was bored and no one had done yet. I didn't have any experience with Telegram bots or running a Lightning Network node, but it turned out to be quite well-received and successful.

As I slowly included things in it, lnurl stuff, custom integrations to other apps and social features, It has a large number of commands and arcane functionality hidden in it. This opaque output of the `/help` command is a hint:

```
/start [<tutorial>]
/lnurl <lnurl>
/receive (lnurl | (any | <satoshis>) [<description>...])
/pay (lnurl <satoshis> | [now] [<invoice>] [<satoshis>])
/send [anonymously] <satoshis> [<receiver>...] [--anonymous]
/balance [apps]
/apps
/tx <hash>
/log <hash>
