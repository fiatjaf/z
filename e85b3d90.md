# trustedcoin

A `lightningd` plugin that replaces a bitcoind node with trusted public explorers. Great so one can run a c-lightning node on a VPS without having to bother with an expensive bitcoind.

It uses multiple explorers and alternates between them, parses blocks and compares them with block hashes taken from other explorers so if someone is trying to trick you at least your node will crash instead of assuming all is fine.

It is used on [[2495e7ef]] and [[9bd81535]].
