# localchat

A server that creates instant chat rooms with [Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and normal HTTP `POST` requests (instead of WebSockets which are an overkill most of the times).

It defaults to a room named as your public IP, so if two machines in the same LAN connect they'll be in the same chat automatically -- but then you can also join someone else's LAN if you need.

This is supposed to be useful.
