# lnchannels

A browser for public Lightning Network channels that updates daily, shows some unexpected charts and tries to use some chain analysis and other heuristics to determine who opened the channels, who closed, what was the state of the closure, what node software each entity is using and other things.

It consists of a Python script that fetches and does things with data before saving it to a Postgres database, a [Postgrest](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/) server and a static site that gets data from Postgrest.
