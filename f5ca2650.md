# Drivechain

Drivechain is sidechain privatization.

Understanding Drivechain requires a shift from the paradigm most bitcoiners are used to. It is not about "trustlessness" or "mathematical certainty", but game theory and incentives.

(Well, Bitcoin in general is also that, but people prefer to ignore it and focus on some illusion of trustlessness provided by mathematics.)

There are 3 main things needed to understand Drivechain:

  * Why Drivechain?
  * Why not a full-blown trustless and open sidechain technology?
  * What are the incentives in question.
