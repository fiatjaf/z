# Alternatives to Drivechain

If Drivechain doesn't get soft-forked into [[bitcoin]], the alternatives people are left with are:

  * Altcoins. People who want super-powers move their stake to shitcoins. This doesn't make much sense because even if altcoins had the necessary technology they wouldn't have the base money with which to use the technology, but still this remains an option.
  * Fully-custodial and trusted systems. Instead of moving their money to a sidechain secured by Drivechain people can use a centralized service with much less safety and subject to all kinds of regulations, hacks and government takedowns.
  * Less secure sidechain-like constructions, like sidechains secured by a multisig of a fixed set of entities with names, or BTC tokens in other blockchains guaranteed by a collateral denominated in shitcoins.
