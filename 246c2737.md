# Websites For Trello

Names like _"blablabla for trello"_ were the official recommendation from Trello for anyone doing services that integrated with it.

This one generated websites from cards and lists on a board.

The websites were generated from a fixed HTML template that were possible to be styled using the standard for CSS and JS plugins I've created, [[b24a7e10|classless]].

It was very complex, used RabbitMQ, a Python tasker that constantly rebuilt the sites on a Postgres database, Trello webhooks, a Go server that just sent the data to the client, I don't remember, but it was terrible design, although it was fun to think of the many branches and complexities of it, but also a huge amount of mostly wasted work.

It had some few paying users for a time.
