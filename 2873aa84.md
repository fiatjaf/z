# How to attack Bitcoin, Anthony Towns' take

In his [Bitcoin in 2021](http://www.erisian.com.au/wordpress/2021/01/07/bitcoin-in-2021) blog post, Anthony Towns lists some strategies that can be used to attack Bitcoin without it looking like an attack:

  1. Big companies centralizing funding on them. If a big company like Square, for example, pays most of the development work it can pretty much control the focus of the project and what PRs will be prioritized and what will be ostracized (and they could even make it look like multiple companies are doing it when in fact all the money and power is coming from a single one).
  2. Attackers "willing to put in the time to establish themselves as Bitcoin contributors", which is an effort some individuals may be doing, and a big company like Square can fund.
  3. Creating changes that seem to improve things but are ultimately unnecessary and introducing deliberate vulnerabilities there. All these vulnerabilities are super hard to spot even by the most experienced reviewers.
  4. Creating more and more changes, and making them all pristine and correct, exhausting all the patience of reviewers, just to introduce a subtle bug somewhere in the middle. The more changes happening, more people will need to review. This gets much worse if for every 10 people 6 or 7 are being funded by the same attacker entity to just generate more noise while purposefully leaving the review work to the other, unpaid honest contributors.
  5. Moving code around for the sake of modularization gives an attacker the opportunity to change small things without anyone noticing, because reviewers will be looking at the changes expecting them to be just the same old code moved to other places, not changed. Even harder to spot.
  6. Another way of gaining control of the repository and the development process is to bribe out honest developers into making other things, so they'll open up space for malicious developers. For example, if a company like Square started giving grants for Bitcoin Core developers to relax a little and start working on cooler projects of their own choices while getting paid much more, they would very likely accept it.
  7. Still another way is to make the experience of some honest contributors very painful and annoying or ostracizing them. He cites what might be happening today with LukeDashjr, one of the most important and competent Bitcoin Core developers, who doesn't get any funding from anyone, despite wanting it and signing up for grant programs.
