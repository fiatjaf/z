# Rust's `.into()` is a strictly bad thing

It just makes the code unreadable for no gain.

Instead of defining methods with readable and meaningful names for transforming objects into other objects and calling those, the `.into()` bad practice just teaches everybody to write `.into()` everywhere, making the code impossible to read without a superpowered editor -- and sometimes [even with it](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/15315).
