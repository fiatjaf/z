# Flowi.es

At the time I thought [Workflowy][workflowy] had the ideal UI for everything. I wanted to implement my [[dc2e9161|custom app maker]] on it, but ended up doing this: a platform for enhancing Workflowy with extra features:

- An email reminder based on dates input in items
- A website generator, similar to [[246c2737]], also based on [[b24a7e10]]

Also, I didn't remember this was also based on CouchDB and had some _couchapp_ functionalities.
