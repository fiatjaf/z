# fieldbook-to-sql

This used to turn books from the late multi-things-manager (or tridimensional spreadsheets provider) [fieldbook.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20180103200604/https://fieldbook.com/) into complete SQLite3 databases.

It was referenced in their official shutdown message and helped people move data off (it would have been better if they had open-sourced the entire site, I don't understand why they haven't).
