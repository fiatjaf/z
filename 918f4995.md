# idea: Link sharing incentivized by satoshis

See <https://2key.io/> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEwRv7qw4fY&t=192s>.

I think the general idea is to make a self-serving automatic referral program for individual links, but I wasn't patient enough to deeply understand neither of the above ideas.

Solving fraud is an issue. People can fake clicks.

One possible solution is to track conversions instead of clicks, but then it's too complex as the receiving side must do stuff and be trusted to do it correctly.
