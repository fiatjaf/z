# Bitcoin, not you

Bitcoin is not here to delight you. Bitcoin doesn't exist so you can receive money and trustlessly verify that you received money in your own node, which you _use_. Bitcoin is not about your desire of being "self-sovereign" and "your own bank". Bitcoin is a gift from God that will bring the end of all inflation, all its other characteristics are secondary.

Bitcoin is not money if not for the others.
