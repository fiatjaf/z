# piln

Piln was a prepaid IPFS pinning service you could use anonymously and instantaneously with the Bitcoin payments over the Lightning Network.

Similar to <https://eternum.io/>, but anonymous, loginless and very very cheap. The cheapness wouldn't scale because it needed a local HD to store data, couldn't work with services like S3 because IPFS is very bad ([I actually tried to make it work](https://github.com/fiatjaf/go-ds-s3)).

Discontinued because IPFS is terrible.
