# Soft-fork activation through `bitcoind` competition

Or: how to activate [[drivechain|_Drivechain_]].

Imagine a world in which there are 10 different `bitcoind` flavors, as described in [[aa9d0a2c]].

Now how do you enable a soft-fork?

Flavor 1 enables it.
Seeing that nothing bad happened, flavor 2 enables it.
Then flavor 3 enables it.

And so on.

When what is perceived by miners to be a big chunk of support for the proposal, a miner can try to mine a block that contains the new feature.

No need for a flag day or a centralized decision making process that depends on one or two courageous leaders to enable a timer.

This probably sounds silly, and maybe is.
