# IPFS problems: Too much immutability

Content-addressing is unusable with an index or database that describes each piece of content. Since IPFS is fully content-addressable, nothing can be done with it unless you have a non-IPFS index or database, or an internal protocol for dynamic and updateable links.

The IPFS [conceit](bdd1cc23) made then go with the with the second option, which proved to be [a failure](6bf9579a). They even incentivized the creation of a [database powered by IPFS](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), which couldn't be more misguided.
