# mcldsp

A tool that migrates data from a [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/) SQLite3 database into PostgreSQL so one can keep Lightning channels and everything but change the underlying database.

It's a mostly manual thing, and I keep following changes in the database schema on c-lightning's GitHub repo so I can update the migration specs whenever needed.
