# Etleneum

A programmable escrow for satoshis with self-contained stateful micro-apps defined with Lua anyone can create and call to deposit money while simultaneously changing their state.

Also known as "the centralized smart contract platform", in opposition to the supposedly "decentralized" Ethereum platform.

The "smart contracting" features of Etleneum are very similar to the ones on Ethereum.
