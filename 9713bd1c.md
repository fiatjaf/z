# contratos.alhur.es

A website that allowed people to fill a form and get a standard _Contrato de Locação_.

Better than all the other "templates" that float around the internet, which are badly formatted `.doc` files.

It was fully programmable so other templates could be added later, but I never did.
This website made maybe one dollar in Google Ads (and Google has probably stolen these like so many other dollars they did with their bizarre requirements).
