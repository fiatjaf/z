# neuron.vim

I started using this [neuron][neuron] thing to create an update this same [[797984e3|zettelkasten]], but the [existing vim plugin](https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim) had too many problems, so I forked it and ended up changing almost everything.

Since the upstream repository was somewhat abandoned, most users and people who were trying to contribute upstream migrate to my fork too.
